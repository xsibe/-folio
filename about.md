<br/>


I am currently a dual-enrolled first year student in the Digital Humanities MA Program and a second-year MS student in the Department of Scientific Computing at Florida State University. My focus is on 3D modeling cultural heritage objects and their impact on methods of preservation and museum outreach. I hold a Bachelors of Science degree in Computational Science with a minor in Mathematics from Florida State University.
<br/>
<br/>
My current interests include augmented reality, 3D modeling of landscapes, digital reconstruction, and teaching humanities with 3D modeling in mind.
